title: The Suitcase
type: text/vnd.tiddlywiki

//In this suitcase you can encounter traces from four groups of worlds, all related to migration, but different:  The eclectic and neo-colonial world of Raymond Roussel's poem "Nouvelles Impressions d'Afrique,", photos and recollections of migrants relatives to from Georgia to Greece, made in 2015 by a young migrant from Georgia, videos made collaboratively with migrants to Greece from 5 different nationalities, and an excerpt from a short story describing a homeless dervish living in Athens at the turn of the 20th century.  The suitcase itself is an evolving memory machine migrating between venues from Canada to Europe, and the memories that it will trace are your own words and interactions with it.  You can weave and shape these memories by entering your texts in a chat room accessible over wifi or through the keyboard and screen inside the suitcase.//
