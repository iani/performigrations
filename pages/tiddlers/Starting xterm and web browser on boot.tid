title: Starting xterm and web browser on boot
type: text/vnd.tiddlywiki

See: http://www.raspberry-projects.com/pi/pi-operating-systems/raspbian/gui/auto-run-browser-on-startup

Edit the autostart file:

```
sudo nano /etc/xdg/lxsession/LXDE/autostart
```

Comment out everything using a '#' at the start of each line and then add the following lines

```
# Auto run the browser
@xset s off
@xset -dpms
@xset s noblank
@midori -e Fullscreen -a http://google.com
```

If necessary use the configuration tool to enable auto running of the GUI on powerup

```
sudo raspi-config
```

If you're using wheezy you can log in automatically by editing /etc/inittab

Search for the line:

``1:23:respawn:/sbin/getty 38400 tty1``
Add a hash tag in front of it

``#1:23:respawn:/sbin/getty 38400 tty1``
This will disable the line. Next you need to add a new entry:

``1:2345:respawn:/bin/login -f pi tty1 </dev/tty1 >/dev/tty1 2>&1``

Where pi is the username of the account you want to use for automatic log in.
Note that this bypasses security, allowing access to your PI without the password of the user.

Your question has been answered for if you're talking about just booeting into a tty instead of your DM, so I'll answer how you'd just start your terminal emulator on X startup.

This is just as easy. Edit your /home/user/.xinitrc:

``exec gnome-terminal &``

and add the above line. Replace gnome-terminal with your term of choice. The ampersand is to make it execute and send to the background so it doesn't lock up X when it starts.

!!! Own suggestion 

Try booting a fresh install of the system (NOOBS?) with a screen attached.  This should

You cannot run startx or any GUI applications through SSH. 
You need to use RDP or other similar application.
Here is a tutorial on how I set up RDP:

This isn't true. OpenSSH supports forwarding of the Xserver and will very much allow you to run your graphical applications.
